## README

NIMBLE (**N**on-parametr**I**c jeans **M**odeling with **B**-sp**L**in**E**s) is a tool for inferring the cumulative mass distribution of a gravitating system from full 6D phase space coordinates of its tracers via spherical Jeans modeling. Spherical Jeans modeling inherently assumes the system is spherically symmetric and in dynamical equilibrium, however, Rehemtulla+2021 show that these conditions are not completely necessary for an accurate mass profile estimate when applied mock Milky Way-like galaxies. Rehemtulla+2021 gives much more detail on the routines included here and extensive tests using them.  



NIMBLE also includes codes for performing related tasks:

- Creating a variety of equilibrium mock galaxies using the Agama library (https://github.com/GalacticDynamics-Oxford/Agama)
- Creating mock Gaia & DESI observational data of the Latte cosmological hydrodynamic zoom in simulations (Wetzel+2016, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...827L..23W)
